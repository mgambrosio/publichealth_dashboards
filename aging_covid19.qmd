<h2 style="font-size: 20px;">**The COVID-19 Pandemic and the Aging American Population: Data Exploration**</h2>

In February 2020, the first case of the novel coronavirus emerged in the U.S, and since then, it has taken the lives of Americans regardless of their race or age group. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the three main domains for healthy aging, function, health status, and social inclusion. Due to prevention guidelines and high peak of infections, older Americans faced more barriers to maintaining a high level of mental and physical functioning and maintain an active engagement with life. The age group was also at higher risk for disease and disability due to age-related physiological changes such as decreased cardiac output and impaired gas exchange of the lungs. The primary objectives of this exploratory analysis are to (1) understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the American population 65 years and older, and (2) understand the challenges and prospects to support older adults in the U.S.

# Methods

This analysis was developed using global COVID-19 reports (i.e., retrieved from our World in data) and the 2020 United States Census administrative data. The measures calculated were crude death rate, incidence rate, vaccination rate, and proportionate mortality. The policies evaluated were the COVID-19 vaccine policy and Medicaid Expansion. Data pre-processing and analysis were performed using SAS® and R programming language.


# Results

## Column 1 {.sidebar}

Results suggest that the COVID-19 vaccine policy was fundamental in reducing the spread of the disease and the surge of new cases. In earlier summer, as vaccines became available and approximately more than half of the population was fully vaccinated, new cases declined dramatically. Nevertheless, as the more contagious Delta variant emerged incidence rate increased in July and August. Illinois was the state with a higher COVID-19 death rate, 129 deaths per 100,000 people, while New York was the state that presented a lower death rate, 79 deaths per 100,000 people. The COVID-19 death rate in Georgia and Florida were 96 and 101 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. The rate of deaths in California was 84 deaths per 100,000. On average, states without Medicaid Expansion presented a COVID-19 mortality rate 6.42% higher than states with expansion.

# Discussion

More than 600,000 Americans have died due to the infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (New York Times, 2021). Individuals aged 65 and older represented 81% of those deaths. States without Medicaid Expansion presented a crude death rate 13.7% higher than states with expansion. Therefore, regardless of approving Medicaid Expansion or not, the same trend is observed among states. Moreover, analysis indicate that states without Medicaid Expansion presented a COVID-19 proportionate mortality rate 11% higher than states with expansion.Death rates among older adults are extremely higher compared to other age groups. The COVID-19 pandemic only came to uncover and exacerbate an important problem within the American Health System. Even though Medicare provides medical coverage to Americans aged 65 and older, it does not yield custodial care (Feder, Komisar & Niefeld, 2000). High costs of long-term care (LTC) force older adults to rely on unpaid family caregivers (Dodge, 2018). The disease also negatively impacted the nursing home industry. Nursing homes occupancy rates decreased by approximately 14% from the first quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021 (Barone, 2021). Further research is needed to analyze if exists a causal relationship between Medicaid Expansion and the state’s capability to manage the COVID-19 crisis.
